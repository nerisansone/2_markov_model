but we had to change our purpose about san miguel, for a storm came up about noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense dictated a run for shelter. therefore we steered for the nearest island of the group,fayal (the people there pronounce it fy-all, and put the accent on the first syllable). we anchored in the open roadstead of horta, half a mile from the shore. the town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants. its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more attractive. it sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear to their summits,not a foot of soil left idle. every farm and every acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that blow there. these hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava walls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards. the islands belong to portugal, and everything in fayal has portuguese characteristics about it. but more of that anon. a swarm of swarthy, noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating portuguese boatmen, with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship's sides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore at so much a head, silver coin of any country. we landed under the walls of a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders, which horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever to get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it. the group on the pier was a rusty one,men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars. they trooped after us, and never more while we tarried in fayal did we get rid of them. we walked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us. and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. it was very flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation. here and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable portuguese hoods on. this hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a marvel of ugliness. it stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is unfathomably deep. it fits like a circus tent, and a woman's head is hidden away in it like the man's who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera. there is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote, as they call it,it is just a plain, ugly dead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can't go within eight points of the wind with one of them on. she has to go before the wind or not at all. the general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.
